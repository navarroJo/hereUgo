hereUgo
=======

hereUgo is a simple, light weight and easy to use modal jQuery plug-in. It was originally built to display completed web design projects with photos of the site, information about the project and what when into completing it, but it works as an everything modal as well. No on page JavaScript required, all you have to do is add the files and markup.
